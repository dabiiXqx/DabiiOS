hi to whoever is reading this, did you ever see a lone 13 year old trying to make a kernel?
no? well here i am, writing this. this file is supposed to help me cope with whatever's not working,
especially the interrupt descriptor table. that's all i have to say, so cya next time

for some reason this stupid IDT refuses to work, i dont understand what's going on, is it the-
memory layout or am i setting gates incorrectly? the EIP keeps going to 0x3 for seemingly
no reason.

might be because of this? "Section: .bss (0x3)"
